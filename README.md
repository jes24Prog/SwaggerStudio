# Swagger Studio

Swagger Studio is a powerful, web-based editor and visualizer for OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications. It provides a seamless experience for developers to write, validate, and preview API documentation in real-time, with a side-by-side editor and multiple rendering options.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Live Editing**: Edit your OpenAPI specification in YAML or JSON and see the changes reflected instantly in the preview pane.
- **Dual Preview Modes**:
  - **Swagger UI**: An interactive UI that allows you to explore and test API endpoints directly.
  - **Redoc**: Generates clean, three-panel documentation for a more readable experience.
- **Real-time Validation**: The editor validates your specification against the OpenAPI 3.1 schema as you type, highlighting errors and providing helpful feedback.
- **Project Management**:
  - **Save & Open**: Save your specifications as projects directly in your browser's local storage.
  - **New Projects**: Start fresh with a basic API template.
- **Import & Export**:
  - **Import**: Drag and drop a `.yaml` or `.json` file onto the editor or use the file menu to load an existing specification.
  - **Export**: Download your current specification as either a `spec.yaml` or `spec.json` file.
- **Templates**: Kickstart your work with pre-built templates, including a basic starter API and the classic Petstore API.
- **Responsive Design**: A fluid layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices. On mobile, you can easily toggle between the editor and preview views.
- **Dark & Light Themes**: Switch between themes to suit your preference.
- **Code Formatting**: Automatically format your YAML or JSON code with a single click for better readability.
